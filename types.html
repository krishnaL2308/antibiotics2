Some of the common antibiotics are Penicillins, Cephalosporins, Macrolides, , Carbapenems Aminoglycosides, Sulfonamides and, Tetracyclines.
<ul>
<li>Penicillins such as penicillin and amoxicillin</li>
<li>Cephalosporins such as cephalexin (Keflex)</li>
<li>Macrolides such as erythromycin (E-Mycin), clarithromycin (Biaxin), and azithromycin(Zithromax)</li>
<li>Carbapenems such as ciprofolxacin (Cipro), levofloxacin (Levaquin), and ofloxacin(Floxin)</li>
<li>Sulfonamides such as co-trimoxazole (Bactrim) and trimethoprim (Proloprim)</li>
<li>Tetracyclines such as tetracycline (Sumycin, Panmycin) and doxycycline (Vibramycin)</li>
<li>Aminoglycosides such as gentamicin (Garamycin) and tobramycin (Tobrex)</li>

</ul>
<h3>What are Penicillins?</h3>
<p>
Penicillins are a type of antibiotic derived from Penicillium fungi. An antibiotic is a type of medicine that inhibits the growth of, or kills, bacteria.
</p>
<p>
Penicillin G (also called benzylpenicillin) was discovered by accident in 1928. Alexander Fleming, a Scottish physician-scientist was growing a type of bacteria called Staphylococcus Aureus on an uncovered petri dish when it became contaminated with mold spores. He observed that the areas of bacteria near the mold were dying. He isolated the substance from the mold that was killing the bacteria and called it penicillin.
</p>
<p>
Another naturally occurring penicillin, penicillin V was later isolated from the same mold. All other penicillins are semi-synthetic (made by modifying the structure of the original naturally occurring penicillins). Modification extends their spectrum of activity, allows them to be taken orally, and increases their resistance against penicillinase, an enzyme produced by some bacteria that inactivates penicillin.
</p>
<p>
Penicillins work by preventing the cross linking of amino acid chains in the bacterial cell wall. This does not affect pre-existing bacteria, but newly produced bacterial cells have weak cell walls that easily rupture.
</p>
<h3>
What are Cephalosporins?</h3>
<p>
Cephalosporins are a large group of antibiotics derived from the mold Acremonium (previously called Cephalosporium). Cephalosporins are bactericidal (kill bacteria) and work in a similar way to penicillins. They bind to and block the activity of enzymes responsible for making peptidoglycan, an important component of the bacterial cell wall. They are called broad-spectrum antibiotics because they are effective against a wide range of bacteria.
</p>
<p>
Since the first cephalosporin was discovered in 1945, scientists have been improving the structure of cephalosporins to make them more effective against a wider range of bacteria. Each time the structure changes, a new "generation" of cephalosporins are made. So far there are five generations of cephalosporins. All cephalosporins start with cef, ceph, or kef. Note that this classification system is not used consistently from country to country.
</p>
<h3>
What are Macrolides?</h3>
<p>
Macrolides are a class of antibiotics derived from Saccharopolyspora erythraea (originally called Streptomyces erythreus), a type of soil-borne bacteria.
</p>
<p>
Macrolides inhibit protein synthesis in bacteria by reversibly binding to the P site of the 50S unit of the ribosome. Macrolides mainly affect gram-positive cocci and intracellular pathogens such as mycoplasma, chlamydia, and legionella. Erythromycin was the first macrolide discovered; other macrolides include azithromycin, clarithromycin, and roxithromycin.
</p>
<p>
Their action is primarily bacteriostatic but may be bactericidal at high concentrations, or depending on the type of microorganism.
</p>
<h3>
What are Aminoglycosides?</h3>
<p>
Aminoglycosides are a class of antibiotics used mainly in the treatment of aerobic gram-negative bacilli infections, although they are also effective against other bacteria including Staphylococci and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. They are often used in combination with other antibiotics.

Aminoglycosides are thought to work by inhibiting protein synthesis inside bacteria. Kill rates of bacteria are increased when higher concentrations of aminoglycosides are present; however, the margin between a safe and a toxic dose is narrow and monitoring is often needed, although once daily dosing increases the safety window. Impairment of kidney function and hearing loss are the most common side effects of aminoglycosides. Aminoglycosides tend to be used when other less toxic antibiotics are contraindicated or ineffective.

</p>
<h3>What are Sulfonamides?</h3>
<p>
Sulfonamides (sulphonamides) are a group of man-made (synthetic) medicines that contain the sulfonamide chemical group. They may also be called sulfa drugs.
</p>
<p>
Many people use the term sulfonamide imprecisely to refer only to antibiotics that have a sulfonamide functional group in their chemical structure. However, there are several non-antibiotic sulfonamides that have been developed by exploiting observations made during the clinical evaluation of the antibiotic sulfonamides. These are used for a range of conditions such as diabetes and pain relief.
</p>
<p>
Sulfanilamide was the first sulfonamide developed in 1906, although it was not used as an antimicrobial agent until the late 1930s. Sulfonamide antimicrobials are bacteriostatic (stop bacteria from reproducing but don't necessarily kill them) and work by interfering with the synthesis of folic acid in bacteria, which is essential for nucleic acid formation and ultimately DNA and RNA. Humans obtain folic acid from their diet, but bacteria need to synthesize it. Sulfonamide antimicrobials may be combined with trimethoprim to make them bactericidal (kill bacteria), because trimethoprim acts on a different enzyme in the folic acid synthesis pathway.
<p>

<h3>
What are Tetracyclines?
</h3>
<p>
Tetracyclines are a class of antibiotics that may be used to treat infections caused by susceptible microorganisms such as gram positive and gram negative bacteria, chlamydiae, mycoplasmata, protozoans, or rickettsiae.
They were discovered in the 1940s and the first tetracyclines were obtained or derived from Streptomyces bacteria.

Tetracyclines inhibit protein synthesis in the microbial RNA (an important molecule that acts as a messenger for DNA). They are primarily bacteriostatic which means that they prevent bacteria from multiplying but don't necessarily kill them.
</p>
<h3>
What are Carbapenems?
</h3>
<p>Carbapenems are a class of beta-lactam antibiotic that are active against many aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Thienamycin was the first carbapenem to be discovered in 1976. Carbapenems are notable for their ability to inhibit beta-lactamase enzymes (also called penicillinase) - a type of enzyme that greatly reduces the activity of antibiotics such as penicillins and cephamycins. Of all the beta-lactam antibiotics, carbapenems possess the broadest spectrum of activity and the greatest potency against bacteria. Because of this, they are often reserved for more severe infections or used as "last-line" agents.

Carbapenems inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to the penicillin-binding proteins and interfering with cell wall formation.
